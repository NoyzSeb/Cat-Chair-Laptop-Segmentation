This project's purpose is to create a model that will detect and segmentate cats, laptops and chairs. In this project i did create an a.i model with YoloV8 API. When i was using the api i got used "Ultralytics Yolo with python" documentations. YoloV8 presents you different pretrained models and not trained models with the same architecture and i decided the move with yoloV8l.pt model to train my model in my purpose.

Repository includes only the usage scripts, model's result charts and predicted photos. Predictions named with "pn". Number of try(n).

This demo is created by myself for an internship interview demo.
